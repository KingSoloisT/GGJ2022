//Level Narration

narrative1 = 
"I'd been chasing this lead for weeks, and feelin' real burned out. 
Between late nights, constant city rain, and hassle from that dame... 
All about her missing husband. He disappeared without a trace. 
Still, there's worse things than gettin' a fistful of cash 
from a beautiful woman on a Friday night."

narrative2 = 
"I guess all the weirdos are out tonight. Some lowlife in a bad 
coat trying to make things hard for me... 
Too bad I've got as many leads as bullets for my revolver. 
Looks like his luck's run in while mine's run out."

narrative3 = 
"The place was starting to give me the creeps. The closer I got 
to the roof of the building, the more footsteps I could hear. 
I thought the place was empty, but I guess four walls and a roof 
is better than a brown bag and a streetlight."

 narrative4 = 
"I didn't know who the mystery guys were, but frankly, I didn't 
much care. What I did know was if I got too close I wound up 
back at the door. I don't care for surprises either, but it didn't 
look like was leaving the place without one..."

 narrative5 = 
"When I thought about it, I don't even remember that woman walking 
into my office. What was her name? Where'd she come from? 
And how did I wind up in this building?"

 narrative6 = 
"I could tell the top floor wasn't much further... I'd gone up six 
floors and I only counted ten from the outside. I never like to be 
sure of anything, but somebody had that light on up there, and 
I was damn sure I'd find my guy."

 narrative7 = 
"It was 3:00am and I was ready to clock out. Nobody said this job 
would be easy, but they didn't exactly mention strange shadows
hounding my every move..."

 narrative8 = 
"I felt like my mind was slipping. The walls were closing in, there 
were voices in the air, and shadows mimicking my every move. 
It had come to a point where I had to ask myself: 
was I making my way toward an answer? Or more questions?"

 narrative9 = 
"This was it. Past this floor was the answer to my case, and the 
rest of that cash from... what was her name?  It didn't matter anymore. 
I had a job to do, and it was time to get it done."

 narrative10 = 
"There I was. Face to face with the guy I'd been searching for 
since this all began... Had it been days? Weeks? 
I couldn't see his face through the smoke and darkness,
but I knew without a shadow of doubt it was him."

 narrative11 =
"There I was on the rooftop with a pocketful photos I couldn't explain. 
But it didn't matter anymore, none of it mattered.
I dropped the pictures off the side of the building. 
I figure maybe I'm done chasing ghosts. At least for a little while..."

//PHOTO NARRATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 photonar1 =
"Hmm? A photo. Looks like that woman with some guy."

 photonar2 =
"Another photo. Same people from the last picture, but in 
front of a house this time... wait a minute, is that 
someone in the window?"

 photonar3 =
"Same happy couple, something's off though... 
they don't know their picture is being taken...."

 photonar4 =
"Hey where'd the woman go? That's a shame. Just the
guy in his backyard."

 photonar5 =
"Backyard again, but no guy or gal this time. Hold on... 
is that blood?"

 photonar6 =
"Just a picture of a spot in the woods. The ground 
was disturbed right there..."

 photonar7 =
"There's the guy again, out cutting his grass. He 
looks different... something off about his eyes..."

 photonar8 =
"Can't make out the picture this time, it's covered in dried 
blood or something..."

 photonar9 =
"Is that a body? And who's that in the background? 
The guy from the window? Who took this?"

 photonar10 =
"Wait that's her! The woman from my office! 
What's happening here?"
