//Level Narration

var narrative1 = 
"I'd been chasing this lead for weeks, and feelin' burned out 
from a combination of the constant city rain and hassle from that 
broad about her husband. Still, there's worse things than gettin' 
a fistful of cash from a beautiful woman on a Friday night."

var narrative2 = 
"I guess all the weirdos are out tonight. Some lowlife in a bad 
coat was trying to make things difficult for me, too bad I 
couldn't afford ammo for my revolver. I guess he's lucky that 
I ain't."

var narrative3 = 
"The place was starting to give me the creeps. The closer I got 
to the roof of the building, the more footsteps I could hear. I 
thought the place was empty but I guess four walls and a roof is 
better than a bag and a streetlight."

var narrative4 = 
"I didn't know who the mystery guys were and frankly, I didn't 
much care. What I did know, was if I got too close I wound up 
back at the door. I don't care for surprises either but it didn't 
look like was leaving the place without one."

var narrative5 = 
"When I thought about it, I didn't remember that broad even walking 
into my office. How did she get there? And how did I get to that 
apartment building?"

var narrative6 = 
"I could tell the top floor wasn't much farther. I'd gone up six 
floors and I only counted ten from the outside. I never like to be 
sure of anything, but somebody was putting that light up there, and 
I was damn sure I'd find my guy."

var narrative7 = 
"I felt like my mind was slipping. The walls were closing, there 
were voices in the air and shadows in bad coats and shoddy hats 
still mimicked my every move. It had come to a point where I had 
to ask myself, was I making my way toward and answer? Or more 
questions?"

var narrative8 = 
"It was 3:00am and I was ready to clock out. Nobody said this job 
would be easy, but they didn't exactly mention inexplicable 
phenomena either."

var narrative9 = 
"This was it. Past this floor was the answer to my case, and the 
rest of that cash from...what was her name?  It didn't matter. I 
had a job to do, and it was time to get to work."

var narrative10 = 
"There I was. Face to face with the guy I'd been searching for 
since day 1. I couldn't see his face through the smoke and darkness,
but I knew it was him."

var narrative11 =
"There I was on a cold rooftop with a series of photos I couldn't 
explain. I dropped the pictures off the side of the building and 
headed home, I figure maybe I'm done chasing ghosts for a while..."

//PHOTO NARRATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

var photonar1 =
"Hmm? A photo. Looks like a guy in a suit with a dame."

var photonar2 =
"Another photo. Same people from the last picture, in 
front of a house this time... wait a minute, is that 
someone in the window?"

var photonar3 =
"Same happy couple, something's off though... yeah... 
they don't know their picture is being taken...."

var photonar4 =
"Hey where'd the dame go? That's a shame. Just this 
schmuck in his backyard."

var photonar5 =
"Backyard, but no guy or gal this time. Hold on... 
is that blood?"

var photonar6 =
"Just a picture of a spot in the woods. The ground 
was disturbed right there..."

var photonar7 =
"There's the guy again, out cutting his grass. He 
looks different somehow, something about his eyes..."

var photonar8 =
"Can't make out the picture, it's covered in dried 
blood or something..."

var photonar9 =
"Is that a body? And who's that in the background? 
The guy from the window maybe?"

var photonar10 =
"Wait that's her! The woman from my office! 
What happening here?"
