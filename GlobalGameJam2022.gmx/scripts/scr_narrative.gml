//Level Narration

narrative1 = 
"I'd been chasing this lead for weeks, and feelin' burned out 
from a combination of the constant city rain and hassle from that 
broad about her husband. Still, there's worse things than gettin' 
a fistful of cash from a beautiful woman on a Friday night."

narrative2 = 
"I guess all the weirdos are out tonight. Some lowlife in a bad 
coat was trying to make things difficult for me, too bad I 
couldn't afford ammo for my revolver. I guess he's lucky that 
I ain't."

narrative3 = 
"The place was starting to give me the creeps. The closer I got 
to the roof of the building, the more footsteps I could hear. I 
thought the place was empty but I guess four walls and a roof is 
better than a bag and a streetlight."

 narrative4 = 
"I didn't know who the mystery guys were and frankly, I didn't 
much care. What I did know, was if I got too close I wound up 
back at the door. I don't care for surprises either but it didn't 
look like was leaving the place without one."

 narrative5 = 
"When I thought about it, I didn't remember that broad even walking 
into my office. How did she get there? And how did I get to that 
apartment building?"

 narrative6 = 
"I could tell the top floor wasn't much farther. I'd gone up six 
floors and I only counted ten from the outside. I never like to be 
sure of anything, but somebody was putting that light up there, and 
I was damn sure I'd find my guy."

 narrative7 = 
"I felt like my mind was slipping. The walls were closing, there 
were voices in the air and shadows in bad coats and shoddy hats 
still mimicked my every move. It had come to a point where I had 
to ask myself, was I making my way toward and answer? Or more 
questions?"

 narrative8 = 
"It was 3:00am and I was ready to clock out. Nobody said this job 
would be easy, but they didn't exactly mention inexplicable 
phenomena either."

 narrative9 = 
"This was it. Past this floor was the answer to my case, and the 
rest of that cash from...what was her name?  It didn't matter. I 
had a job to do, and it was time to get to work."

 narrative10 = 
"There I was. Face to face with the guy I'd been searching for 
since day 1. I couldn't see his face through the smoke and darkness,
but I knew it was him."

 narrative11 =
"There I was on a cold rooftop with a series of photos I couldn't 
explain. I dropped the pictures off the side of the building and 
headed home, I figure maybe I'm done chasing ghosts for a while..."

//PHOTO NARRATION------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 photonar1 =
"Hmm? A photo. Looks like a guy in a suit with a dame."

 photonar2 =
"Another photo. Same people from the last picture, in 
front of a house this time... wait a minute, is that 
someone in the window?"

 photonar3 =
"Same happy couple, something's off though... yeah... 
they don't know their picture is being taken...."

 photonar4 =
"Hey where'd the dame go? That's a shame. Just this 
schmuck in his backyard."

 photonar5 =
"Backyard, but no guy or gal this time. Hold on... 
is that blood?"

 photonar6 =
"Just a picture of a spot in the woods. The ground 
was disturbed right there..."

 photonar7 =
"There's the guy again, out cutting his grass. He 
looks different somehow, something about his eyes..."

 photonar8 =
"Can't make out the picture, it's covered in dried 
blood or something..."

 photonar9 =
"Is that a body? And who's that in the background? 
The guy from the window maybe?"

 photonar10 =
"Wait that's her! The woman from my office! 
What happening here?"
